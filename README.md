# Operations

A very simple calculator app written in Rust.
It supports basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and exponentation, including parenthesis.

## Requirements

You must have Rust installed (obviously)

## Build and run

    cargo build
    cargo run

After running, you will be able to type operations e.g.:

    Type an operation: 2+2*2     
     = 6/1 = 6
    Type an operation: (4+0.5)*(1/3)
     = 3/2 = 1.5
    Type an operation:

Spaces and invalid characters are not allowed.\
The program has basic error handling implemented but it's not tested.
